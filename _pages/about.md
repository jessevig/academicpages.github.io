Hi, I am a research scientist at [Salesforce Research](https://einstein.ai/) working on NLP and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). My goal is to develop AI systems that are transparent and scrutable. I analyze machine learning models using quantitative methods such as [causal mediation analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12265.pdf) as well as visualization techniques, such as in my work on [BertViz](https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz) and [Provis](https://github.com/salesforce/provis). I am also an avid [blogger](https://medium.com/@JesseVig). In my spare time I have created novel voice applications including the award-winning [100 Years Ago](https://voicebot.ai/2017/12/11/voice-app-100-years-ago-wins-actions-google-developer-challenge/) educational app.
