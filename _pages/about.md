Hi, I am a research scientist at Salesforce Research working on NLP and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). My goal is to develop AI systems that are more transparent and scrutable. I apply both empirical methods such as [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12265.pdf](causal analysis) as well as visualization techniques, e.g., [https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz](BertViz) and [https://github.com/salesforce/provis](ProVis), to better understand AI models. I am also an avid [https://medium.com/@JesseVig](blogger). I have also created novel voice applications including the award-winning [https://voicebot.ai/2017/12/11/voice-app-100-years-ago-wins-actions-google-developer-challenge/](100 Years Ago) educational app.
